Working:
- Map Generation with Tiles, Edges, Junctions, Harbors Numbers and Robber


Work in Progress:
- Placement of Buildings / Updating everything correctly (Implement placement in map.BuildingContainer.placeBuilding())

- game.Game: everything you can do on a turn.
(Future) Issues:
- Map Generation for non standard boards
- coastal Edges are badly specified (see map.Map.fillHarbors())
- Documenting!
